## Straightforward IT Operations and Cybersecurity

Short, focused engagements that keep systems running and secure—practical help, clear advice, measurable improvements.

- **Cybersecurity assessments** (OSINT recon and external exposure discovery; web and API reviews aligned to OWASP; cloud configuration checks with clear repro steps and prioritized fixes)
- **Wi‑Fi and network performance assessments** (coverage, interference, capacity, throughput)
- **IT operations troubleshooting and improvements** (device access and printing issues, secure onboarding, simple network changes)
- **Software and infrastructure consulting** (architecture reviews, right‑sized recommendations)

You’ll get a concise report and an action plan you can execute. Start with a short assessment—no retainers, no lock‑in.
