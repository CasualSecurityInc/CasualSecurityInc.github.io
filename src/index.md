## Straightforward IT Ops and Cybersecurity

Focused engagements that keep systems running and secure: practical help, clear advice, measurable improvements. That's the CSInc philosophy.

- **Cybersecurity assessments** (OSINT recon and external exposure discovery; web and API reviews aligned to OWASP; cloud configuration checks with clear repro steps and prioritized fixes)
- **Wi‑Fi and network performance assessments** (onsite surveys of coverage, interference, throughput and capacity)
- **IT operations troubleshooting and improvements** (device access and network issues, router optimization)
- **Software and infrastructure consulting** (architecture reviews, right‑sized recommendations)

You’ll get a concise report and an action plan you can execute. Start with a short assessment — no retainers, no lock‑in.
